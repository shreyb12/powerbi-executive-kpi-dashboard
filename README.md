## Overview
An executive-ready Power BI dashboard built to monitor **commercial and operational KPIs** with a clean KPI framework, intuitive drilldowns, and variance analysis.  
Designed with a **semantic model-first approach** for scalable self-service reporting and performance.

---

## What I built
- **KPI framework** (Revenue / Margin / Volume / On-time / Utilization — adaptable)
- **Executive summary** view + **drill-through** detail pages for root-cause analysis
- **Variance analysis** (Actual vs Target, MoM/YoY deltas, contribution patterns)
- **Model & measure layer** organized for maintainability (clean naming + reusable measures)
- **Performance-focused design** (model hygiene, simplified visuals, efficient measures)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Power BI** (Report design + interaction patterns)
- **DAX** (measures, time intelligence, variance logic)
- **Power Query** (data prep / shaping)
- **Star schema semantic model** (facts + conformed dimensions)
- **Performance optimization** (measure design, relationships, data types)

---

## 📈 Business Impact (typical outcomes)
- Faster decision-making via **single source of truth** KPI reporting
- Improved visibility into **trend + variance** performance for leadership
- Self-service enabled through a **scalable model** and reusable measures
- Reduced manual reporting effort with refresh-ready datasets

## How to use (high-level)
- Use slicers to filter by **region / customer segment / platform / production attributes**
- Start in **Executive Overview** to identify a variance or trend
- Drill into **Trends & Breakdown** to isolate drivers
- Use **Detail / Drilldown** for granular breakdown by Sales Parent / Year

## Notes
- Screenshots and structure are shared for demonstration; **business-sensitive data is removed/anonymized**.
- If you’d like, I can add a **Model Diagram** section (star schema image) and a **DAX Measures** snippet section to make this repo even stronger.
